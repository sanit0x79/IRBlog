        States of Mind is a space where personal perspective meets global politics. Written from the shifting ground between borders, ideologies, and human experience, this blog reflects my ongoing interest of International Relations.        </p>
        
        <p className="mb-6">
        Here, I explore the theories that shape diplomacy, the narratives that define nations, and the quiet forces, identity, perception and belief that often go unspoken in official discourse. My aim isnâ€™t to offer definitive answers, but to ask better questions: What drives state behavior? How does power feel when lived? Where does the individual fit in a world built by systems?        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">As a citizen of a deeply interconnected world, States of Mind is my attempt to think publicly, critically, and sincerely about the issues that matter, from the structural to the subtle.</p>
        <p className="mb-6">Whether you're an IR student, a policy thinker, or someone simply curious about the world and our place in it, you're welcome here.</p>
